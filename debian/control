Description: configuration management system
 Puppet is a server automation tool. It is composed of a declarative
 language for expressing system configuration, a client and server for
 distributing it, and a library for realizing the configuration.
 .
 The primary design goal of Puppet is to have an expressive enough
 language backed by a powerful enough library that you can write your
 own server automation applications in just a few lines of code.
 Puppet’s deep extensibility and open source license lets you add
 functionality as needed and share your innovations with others.
 .
 This package contains the puppet software and documentation. To
 automatically start a puppet agent, install the "puppet" package. To
 install and configure a puppet master, install one of the
 "puppetmaster" or "puppetmaster-passenger" packages.
